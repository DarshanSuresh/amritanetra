# AMRITANETRA – Amrita Network Threat Recognition & Analysis

## 🎯 Objective

Phishing is a prevalent cyber threat that manipulates users into trusting malicious URLs and websites. The objective of **AMRITANETRA** is to train machine learning models and deep neural networks on a curated dataset to detect phishing websites accurately. The system gathers both phishing and legitimate URLs, extracts URL and content-based features, and evaluates model performance to identify the most effective detection approach.

## 🤖 AI Bot Integration (Our Novelty)

AMRITANETRA integrates a **Smart AI Bot** to further enhance phishing detection and user interaction. The AI bot functions as a virtual assistant that interacts with users on the platform. It assists users in identifying suspicious URLs by providing real-time suggestions based on the URL analysis. By integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the AI bot is capable of answering user queries about potential phishing risks and guiding them in real-time about how to protect themselves from phishing attacks. This integration not only provides a user-friendly interface but also helps enhance the overall phishing detection process by incorporating user feedback.

## 🔍 Feature Extraction

The system begins by retrieving URLs to be analyzed. These are submitted through a web interface and processed to extract relevant features from the URLs and web content. Features are derived based on the domain, HTML structure, and address bar contents to train and test the machine learning models effectively.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Several models were trained and compared to identify phishing websites. The best-performing model classifies URLs as either phishing or legitimate based on a learned decision boundary. Predictions are displayed on the front-end interface.
